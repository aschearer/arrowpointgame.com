How to Publish

At this point it's assumed you have an AWS account.

How to Publish a New Site
---

__Create the S3 bucket, CloudFront site, and Route53 configuration using Stout__

Open PowerShell in the project directory. Ensure `deploy.yaml` points to the correct target bucket and local source directory. From the command line enter:

`.\tools\stout\stout-windows.exe create --key {AWS KEY} --secret {AWS SECRET}`

Make sure to replace the key and secret with your AWS account's information. This will create a default configuration suitable for deployment and emit a new user's key and secret for future updates. Be sure to copy the key and secret somewhere safe.

__Configure CloudFront__

Navigate to AWS CloudFront, select the newly created site, and edit its details. Under "SSL Certificate" select "Custom SSL Certificate" and save your changes (if you have not already created your certificate select "Request or Import Certificate" and complete the process). Next navigate to the Behaviors tab and edit the default behavior. Under "Viewer Protocol Policy" select "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" and save changes.
Finally, navigate to the Error Pages tab and configure error pages as necessary for the web page.

__Setup "Bare" Domain__

At this point navigating to `www.yoursite.com` will work as expected. But if the user navigates to `yoursite.com` it will fail. To fix this:

  1. Create a new S3 bucket named `yoursite.com`
  1. Give it public read permissions
  1. Enable "Static Web Hosting"
  1. Configure the hosting to "Redirect Requests", enter "www.yoursite.com"
  1. Go to Route 53
  1. Create a new A-record, it should have no prefix
  1. Mark it as an "Alias"
  1. Select the S3 bucket that pops up in the list (should correspond with the one just created)

How to Publish an Update to an Existing Site
---

Stout generated a user to upload updates. Use the new user's AWS key and secret.

  1. Set the environment variable `AWS_KEY`.
  1. Set the environment variable `AWS_SECRET`.
  1. Run `gulp deploy` to deploy `_site/` to AWS.
